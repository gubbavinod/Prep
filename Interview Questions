1) What is difference between JDK,JRE and JVM?
  
  JVM
      It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
      JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. 
      JVM, JRE and JDK are platform dependent because configuration of each OS differs. But, Java is platform independent.

  JRE
      It is used to provide runtime environment.It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. 
      It contains set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
      Implementation of JVMs are also actively released by other companies besides Sun Micro Systems.
      
  JDK
      It physically exists.It contains JRE + development tools.
      
2) How java is platform independent and dependent based on JVM?

3) What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature?

      The bytecode. Java is compiled to be a byte code which is the intermediate language between source code and machine code. 
      This byte code is not platform specific and hence can be fed to any platform.
      
4) What if I write static public void instead of public static void?

      Program compiles and runs properly.
      
5) What is the default value of the local variables?

      The local variables are not initialized to any default value, neither primitives nor object references.
